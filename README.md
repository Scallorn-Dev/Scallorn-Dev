<h1>Hi, I'm Matthew Scallorn!<br/>

<h2>I write Software in various languages and enjoy doing things that challenge me intellectually.</h2>

<h3>More about me:</h3>

I'm currently finishing my **Bachelor of Science** in **Computer Science**. While I'm not an expert (yet I soon hope to be!), I enjoy learning the ins and outs of complex problems. Problem-solving has grown to be one of my greatest passions. Whether I'm deciding what to have for dinner or sorting an unordered array, a problem is getting solved.
